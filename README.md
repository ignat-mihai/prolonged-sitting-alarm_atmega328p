This is based on https://github.com/DaveBben/prolonged-sitting-alarm. It was made to work with atmega328 instead of attiny85. I also didn't have the special cushion with velostat, so I used a simple button, but that began to fail quite quick. It seems that buttons aren't meant to be pressed for long periods of time.
I switched to an IR sensor, the basic one found on any website with a comparator onboard and I had to change "if (pinValue == 1)" to "if (pinValue == 0)" in is_sitting function and it seems to work.
I plan of putting the device with velcro under the table to sense when I am in front of the desk, tests are still in progress.
